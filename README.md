# Code_Alpha_Machine_Learning_Internship_Projects
This repository contains machine learning projects completed during the CodeAlpha Internship, showcasing data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and optimization using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for real-world applications.



## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Credit Scoring Model**
This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model to evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants. It employs various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of default based on historical data.


### **2. Emotion Recognition From Speech**
In this project, I implemented a model to recognize emotions from speech audio. The aim is to classify emotions using features extracted from the audio signals, facilitating applications in customer service and mental health.


## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Various machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

## **License**
This project is licensed under the **MIT License.**
